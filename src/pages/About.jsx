                    I began my studies as undergratuated student at Technical University of Crete (TUC) 8 years ago. 
                    There I get in touch with IT systems. Especially the course of SQL 
                    inspired me to follow the career of Software Engineer. When I was in University senior year,
                    I took a dissertation with title :
                    <strong> Publication and Subscription Services in Web Applications : Î‘ Comparative Study. </strong>
                    The Publish - Subscribe service is designed to facilitate communication between 
                    applications or users with web applications. 
                    The scope of this dissertation was to compare features and operations supported by 7 Publish-Subscribe systems
                    named Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ, Orion-LD Broker, Scorpio Broker, Stellio Broker, Pushpin & Faye.
                    <strong> Apache Kafka & RabbitMQ </strong> are the most known systems and I was excited when I read about them and their
                    operations. As a consequence, from my thesis published 2 papers.
